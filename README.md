# Word-Embedding-Learning
This project implements custom word embedding learning from a domain-specific corpus using CBOW and Skip-gram models built with Keras (TensorFlow backend). Word representations are learned using one-hot encoded inputs (no pre-trained embeddings), with learning-rate experiments, automatic best-model selection, and cosine similarity for evaluation
